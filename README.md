# LabSticks

The LabSticks project was born out of a need to address a specific problem within the realm of psychological research. Young participants in a local university study were interacting with the traditional keyboard and mouse setup in ways that led to unwanted inputs and disruptions. These interruptions didn't just disrupt the researcher's work; they also jeopardized the accuracy of the study results.

Thus, the idea for LabSticks was conceivedâ€”a custom controller designed with the familiarity of classic "sticks", our affectionate term for gaming controllers. The controller's design, which is not only more intuitive for the young participants but also includes an essential disable feature for use between testing rounds, provides researchers the assurance of undisturbed work. It's a tool that bridges the gap between ergonomics and functionality.

LabSticks leverages the flexibility of GMK firmware and easily accessible components, with the design centered around a custom printed circuit board (PCB) and a 3D printed ergonomic enclosure.

## Design

The controller, designed with the dimensions of a classic gaming controller in mind, houses the necessary components to facilitate inputs for testing software. For more detail check  [CAD Files](https://github.com/JDSiemens/LabSticks/tree/main/CAD%20Files).

The PCB, custom designed and printed, houses the ATmega32u4 microcontroller and the switches. [Also available in CAD Files](https://github.com/JDSiemens/LabSticks/tree/main/CAD%20Files).

The casing for the controller is 3D printed, as is the case for the disable toggle controller. The controller features seven buttons, each corresponding to a specific input.

## Keymaps

The keymaps required are as follows:

| MAP     | GMK Map       | Description                  |
|---------|---------------|------------------------------|
| UP      | KC_KP_8       | Keypad 8                     |
| RIGHT   | KC_KP_6       | Keypad 6                     |
| DOWN    | KC_KP_2       | Keypad 2                     |
| LEFT    | KC_KP_4       | Keypad 4                     |
| BLUE    | KC_MS_BTN1    | Mouse Button 1 (Left click)  |
| ORANGE  | KC_MS_BTN2    | Mouse Button 2 (Right click) |
| START   | KC_ENT        | Enter (Carriage Return)      |
| DISABLE | TG(BLANK_LAYER)| Toggle Keypad Disable        |

## Upcoming Tasks

With the CAD work for the PCB and the enclosures completed, the next steps for this project are:

- Design and build the Y splitter section of the cabling. (printed in TPU)
- Design and build the disable controller
- Source appropriate 6-strand wiring (USB + 2 wires for disable control)

## GMK Firmware

This section will be updated with the necessary code and instructions once they become available.
